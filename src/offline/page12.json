This breaks the previous developer cycle of  being able to change the JavaScript and having those changes reflected on the next application run.\r\n\r\nThis was changed when the \"HasUpToDateBundleInCache\" check was added to the \"ReactInstanceManager.CreateReactContextFromDevManagerAsync()\" that will load the packager bundle from cache if it is up to date.\r\n\r\n@rozele We discussed the possibility of adding a flag to allow the old behavior to be restored.  This is what I've done in this PR.  I've added a flag called \"UseBundleCaching\" to the ReactPage and ReactInstanceManager that will set the IsBundleCachingEnabled flag on the IDevSupportManager.  If the flag is true and the cached bundle is up to date then the \"CreateReactContextFromCachedPackagerBundleAsync\" is executed;  Otherwise the _devSupportManager.CreateReactContextFromPackagerAsync is executed.\r\n\r\nI have chosen to set the default for the new flag to \"true\" so that the existing behavior is not changed.  Let me know if you'd like the flag to be false by default, which will force anybody who wants to use the bundle caching to opt-in rather than the other way around."

But the initialization of bridge happens asynchronously and in parallel to other RN module load. There is no way for the modules to know the initialization state of the bridge. So it is not possible to externally control the invocation of these methods.\r\n\r\nAs a fix, when InvokeFunction or InvokeCallback is called, we execute them if the bridge is there, otherwise we stash them and add them back to the queue when it gets initialized."

If the bug cannot be reproduced, your issue may be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n(Write your steps here:)\r\n\r\n1. Create a `<Text>` component with a nested `<View>` component\r\n2. Add the `<Text/>` component to parent `<View pointerEvents='none'>` component\r\n3. Wrap the whole thing in a `<TouchableWithoutFeedback>` component and add an `onPress` handler.\r\n4. Click the text inline view.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect your project to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen you click the text inline view, the Touchable should not fire the `onPress` handler.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Describe this section in detail, and attach screenshots if possible.\r\n  Don't just say \"it doesn't work\"!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe `onPress` handler fires.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app using https://snack.expo.io/ and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a Snack.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, copy and paste the link to the Snack or a public GitHub repository below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHere's a sample you can paste into the Playground app to reproduce:\r\n```\r\nclass Playground extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => alert('Error!')}>\r\n        <View \r\n          pointerEvents='none'\r\n          style={styles.container}>\r\n          <Text style={styles.welcome}>\r\n            Click the inner view, hope you don't get an alert!\r\n            <View style={{width: 10, height: 10, backgroundColor: 'red'}} />\r\n          </Text>\r\n        </View>\r\n      </TouchableWithoutFeedback>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you click the inline view (the red box), the alert fires even though the click occurred inside the context of `pointerEvents: none`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you,\r\n  but it’s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,\r\n  the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.\r\n\r\n  Please remember that:\r\n\r\n    * Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.\r\n    * The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.\r\n    * You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.\r\n\r\n  Thanks for helping us help you!\r\n-->\r\n"

This is same as the XAML `AllowDrop` property.\r\n- `onDragEnter` simply translates the XAML event to JS.\r\n- `onDragLeave` simply translates the XAML event to JS.\r\n- `onDragOver` sends the event to JS, but doesn't let it change the `AllowDrop` property on the fly.\r\n- `onDrop` sends the event with file descriptors.\r\n\r\nExample of the event object given to `onDrop`:\r\n```js\r\n{ target: 8,\r\n  dataTransfer: \r\n   { files: \r\n      [ { name: 'logo.png',\r\n          size: 96548,\r\n          type: 'image/png',\r\n          uri: 'urn:future-access-list:%7B7420FE1A-D413-43B4-AAE4-C2C3745910D5%7D' },\r\n        { name: 'Releases.md',\r\n          size: 8142,\r\n          type: '',\r\n          uri: 'urn:future-access-list:%7BF8B97F3E-4265-41B5-8D3C-07857D1C6134%7D' } ],\r\n     items: \r\n      [ { kind: 'file', type: 'image/png' },\r\n        { kind: 'file', type: '' } ],\r\n     types: [ 'image/png', '' ] } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotable differences from how this works in XAML:\r\n- `allowDrop=true` is set only once and allows to drop any kind of items. In XAML this property can be changed in the `DragOver` handler to allow only certain types of files or items. Thus the `onDragOver` event sent to JS is notification only: JS can see what's being dropped, but cannot stop that or change the cursor icon.\r\n- The `onDrop` event carries the list of dropped files and only files. This change doesn't support drag & drop for text or other items. The list of files sent to JS is just a list of file uris and file metadata (name, size, etc.).\r\n\r\nThere is an important detail. In UWP an app cannot access arbitrary files by their path, unless these files are in the app folder (the one that contains `LocalState`, `LocalCache` and other dirs). However the user can drag & drop files from anywhere, so if RNW sends paths of these files, the app won't be able to read them. The workaround is to use `FutureAccessList` (FAL):\r\n1. RNW gets a list of `StorageFile` objects from the XAML `Drop` event.\r\n2. Every file object is put to FAL and RNW gets a list of FAL tokens (GUIDs).\r\n3. RNW sends to JS the tokens wrapped into a `urn:future-access-list:{GUID}` format.\r\n\r\nJS cannot use these FAL tokens directly, but it can send them to another RN module that can extract the file objects from FAL using the tokens. The problem is that now JS and other RN modules need to understand this FAL concept.\r\n\r\n  "

This is problematic for ActionQueues that multiple modules share (e.g. NativeModulesQueue). Prior to this change, NativeModulesQueue is the default ActionQueue and is represented as `null` so we never call Dispose on it. One solution would be to start referencing counting the ActionQueues."

Specify Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017 -->\r\n- Visual Studio Version: Visual Studio 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use this code\r\n```\r\nconstructor(props) {\r\n  super(props);\r\n  this.ft = new Animated.Value(0);\r\n}\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n  this.animate(this.ft, 15000);\r\n}\t\r\nanimate(img, time) {\r\n  img.setValue(0);\r\n  Animated.timing(img, {toValue: 1, duration: time, easing: Easing.linear, useNativeDriver: true}).start(()=> this.animate(img, time));\r\n}\r\nrender() {\r\nconst spin = this.ft.interpolate({\r\n  inputRange: [0, 1],\r\n  outputRange: ['0deg', '360deg']\r\n})\r\nreturn(\r\n<View style={{flex:1}}>\r\n<Image source={require('../assets/city.gif')} style={{position: 'absolute', width: screenWidth, height: screenHeight}/>\r\n  <View pointerEvents={'none'} style = {{position: 'absolute'}}>\r\n    <Animated.Image source={somePNGsource} style={{resizeMode: 'contain',\r\n\t\talignSelf: 'center', width: 300, height: 300, transform:\r\n      [{rotate: spin}]}]}/>\r\n  </View>\r\n</View>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSmooth Animation. ( Like it was with the same code, on RN0.49.5 with RNW@0.49.0-rc.2 version)\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAnimations play for about 1.5 sec then gets stuck for multiple seconds then play again and then lag and so on. Its like watching a 1080p video on a 256k modem connection.\r\nUNLESS, you put your Animated.Image in a TouchableOpacity and keep it pressed/clicked/tapped while moving your finger/mouse. Its like constant inputs keeps it playing.\r\nWithout that, everything keeps laggnig UNTIL eventually, the gif stops playing and THEN the animation becomes smooth.\r\n( btw my PNGs being animated are 2k+ in resolution and animated gifs are 50mb+ in size )\r\n"
