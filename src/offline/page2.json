Locally, I added the accessibilityLiveRegion prop to the list of props in `GetNativeProps` in the same file, and then the accessibility label was read when it updated, as I expected. It looks like today accessibilityLiveRegion is being filtered out since it is not in the list in `GetNativeProps`."

It is because we are using the Grid.Background brush to draw image already.\r\n\r\nWhile initial attempt to solve the border and background issue together is to add a border element on top of the Image grid, it works almost all the cases except the broder does not intersect with the background, which is the currently behavior on Android and iOS. We may need something like : \r\nGrid\r\n  - Border (background and border properties)\r\n  - Grid/Canvas(image brush for background)\r\n\r\nSince I am not sure the priority of supporting background on image element, and it looks like the solution is going to be complicated (reparenting, transfer properties), I am leaving out the support for Background property for now and open this issue to track.\r\n\r\n"

It has been moved to react-native-community/geoLocation and deprecated from react-native. However, react-native-community/geoLocation doesn't support windows...yet. Our react-native-windows LocationObserver module is now 'orphaned'.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nIn our UWP calendar app, the weather feature depended on navigator.geoLocation from react-native-windows. The weather feature is now broken.  \r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\nIn the interim, we might consider moving this support to react-native-windows-extended."

If the bug cannot be reproduced, your issue may be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Pass a style to an `Animated.View` that contains a transform or opacity set to an `Animated.Value`\r\n2. Use `Animated.timing` to animate that `Animated.Value` to a new value, with `useNativeDriver: true`\r\n3. Update the `Animated.View` such that it no longer has the `Animated.Value` in its styles\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect your project to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe transform or opacity would reset to initial values. A View translated to the right previously would have that translation removed.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Describe this section in detail, and attach screenshots if possible.\r\n  Don't just say \"it doesn't work\"!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe transform or opacity remain applied, even though the style no longer contains those values.\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43013/67106748-0f851a80-f180-11e9-9acb-ff17ab74b368.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43013/67106781-1a3faf80-f180-11e9-8b68-f30cdd2fdb34.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43013/67106796-21ff5400-f180-11e9-91a4-91ffff251d9e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app using https://snack.expo.io/ and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause.

    "body": "Hello, I am from [React Native Tools VS Code extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-react-native) developement team. In the extension we have special command palette commands to reload the attached app and to show React Native Developer Menu in it. In RN Android we do that via adb commands, in iRN OS we do that via `require('NativeModules').DevMenu.show()` and `require('NativeModules').DevMenu.reload()` during debugging, but in React Native for Windows `0.60.0-vnext.105` there is no `DevMenu` in the `NativeModules` list.\r\n\r\n|React Native iOS|React Native Windows|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32372875/71617038-3f15c180-2bca-11ea-9e56-e67ea31af841.png)|![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32372875/71617506-75ecd700-2bcc-11ea-80af-3d3b33c1ac27.png)|\r\n\r\nSo we'd like to ask if the team plans to implement access to the `DevMenu` from the `NativeModules` package, or maybe there are some other alternatives for programmatically accessing Developer Menu during debugging?"

    "body": "Facebook Metro has a bug facebook/metro#498 that replaces any `/` with the system path separator on blacklist. So expressions like `[/\\\\]` become `[\\\\\\]` on Windows and an invalid regular expression error in thrown when building some React Native for Windows projects.\r\n\r\nTo really fix that we need:\r\n- facebook/metro#498 to get merged\r\n- a new version of Facebook Metro to be released\r\n- a new PR to be created updating Metro version on React Native CLI\r\n- the second PR to get merged\r\n- a new version of React Native CLI to be released\r\n- another PR on this repository updating React Native CLI version\r\n- the final PR to get merged\r\n- a new version of React Native for Windows to be released\r\n\r\nThis long path will occasionally happen, but it will take time. To fix this problem early on React Native for Windows, I propose a workaround that replaces expressions like `[/\\\\]` with just `/` as Facebook Metro will already replace `/` with the correct path separator on each OS.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the version of React Native CLI that we are using has a old version of Facebook Metro that uses `[/\\\\]` expressions, so a local fix here would not help unless we stop using the `blacklist` function from Metro. To solve this problem I've submitted a PR to React Native CLI react-native-community/cli#893 back-porting the Facebook Metro update to React Native CLI 2.x.\r\n\r\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows/pull/3795)"

It appears like sometimes asyncStorage.txt fails to flush the full buffer or something.  There is something, somewhere in AsyncStorage/KeyValueStorage.cpp that I think could be improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically if you end process or have an exception shutdown.   And possibly with a moderate amount(300kb) of data being written to asyncStorage.txt.   Something needs to be improved here so that it can either write the full amount, or none at all? (asyncStorage.txt creates multiple lines of persist:root) and I think it'd be better experience to be able to use the last instance of instead of corrupting it and losing all the data stored there.\r\n\r\nI think I could repro within a few tries if need more information.\r\n"
